   - https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-remove-console/
3. Tree shaking: Removes unwanted code
4. Browser List: The version mentioned the code will transpile to them for sure. Doesn't mean it will not work in other browsers if you mentioned specifically `last 2 Chrome versions`. But it will for sure work on last 2 chrome versions.
